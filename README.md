# My Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio!

Not much to say here, it's a hub where I will be showcasing my projects.

It's fairly light on the amount of technologies used, and it's mostly written from scratch.

## The Front-end

* React
  * React-router
* CSS Modules

## The Back-end

None yet, but I plan to implement a solution that will receive the user input from the contact form and send it to me.

Currently hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://andreymorogan.github.io/deployment/).
